# QuickTableViewer Extension
Qlik Sense Extension to quickly get all fields of a data-model table into a standard Qlik Sense Table object.

Explanation video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3t-yurD4g

**New 16-Mar-2021**: you have an option to turn on/off a show condition on all columns of the table. The condition is checking if the field (still) exists in the datamodel.
If not, it won't stop the chart from showing (as it was before that update), but only hide the respective column.

**Update 10-Sep-2020**: a checkbox that allows to remove a (table-)prefix from Field Names in the label of the column e.g. Customers.Name -> Name 
(everything before the first "." is removed then)

* Place the extension on the sheet where you like to get the table object
* select from the properties panel on your right which table you would like to see
* you can specify a pattern for both, fields to include (default: *) and fields to exclude (default: %* ... all fields starting with %)
* after you click the button "Get My Table" the object manipulates itself to become a standard Sense table object

Thanks to Ralf, you can select multiple tables at once to get columns from more than 1 table. The code checks if there are connections in 
the data model between the tables before adding its columns to avoid cartesean products with out-of-memory results. Ralf explains this
