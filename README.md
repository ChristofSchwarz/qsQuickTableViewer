# qsQuickTableViewer
Qlik Sense Extension to quickly get all fields of a data-model table into a standard Qlik Sense Table object.

* Place the extension on the sheet where you like to get the table object
* select from the properties panel on your right which table you would like to see
* you can specify a pattern for both, fields to include (default: *) and fields to exclude (default: %* ... all fields starting with %)
* after you click the button "Get My Table" the object manipulates itself to become a standard Sense table object
